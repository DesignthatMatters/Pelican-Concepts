Summary: 
	This read-me files provides that instructions need to create a demo pulse ox system using the three leds and an Arduino board.
	This is NOT A WORKING PULSE OX. This system is to simulate how a real pulse ox might indicate to an user how accurate the information
	being collected. 
	
Bill Of Materials (BoM):
	Link to BoM: 
	Arduino software
	Arduino Uno with B usb cable
	three leds (Any color will work)
	Breadboard and Breadboard wires
	Hook-up wires
	9v battery and battery pack
	
Arduino Set up:
	If you have not already download and install Arduino from http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software#.UxSScM7tphE

Programming it all:
	Open the Fritzing diagram and set up the circuit.
	Once this is completed open phtotoresistor_v2 in Arduino and program the Arduino board.
