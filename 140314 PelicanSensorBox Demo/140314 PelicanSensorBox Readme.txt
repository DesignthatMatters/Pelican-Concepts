Summary: 
	This read-me files provides that instructions need to create a demo pulse ox system using the PulseSensor kit from pulsesensor.myshopify.com/ and an Arduino board.
	It incorparated an oled screen and two leds to indicate the heart beat and how well the sensor is working.
	
Bill Of Materials (BoM):
	Link to BoM: 
	Arduino software
	Arduino Uno with B usb cable
	AdafruitCharacterOLED-master library for Arduino
	Adafruit OLED screen	
	Pulse Sensor kit
	two leds (Any color will work)
	Breadboard and Breadboard wires
	Hook-up wires
	9v battery 
	
	Arduino Set up:
	If you have not already download and install Arduino from http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software#.UxSScM7tphE
	After, you have installed Arduino, launch the program and add the Adafruit_CharacterOLED
	To add the libraries go to the sketch tab and click on import library -> add library..
	This will open up a dialogue window where you can navigate to where you have saved the libraries that you want to add.
	Select the Adafruit libraries and add them to the sketch. 	

Programming it all:
	Open the Fritzing diagram and set up the circuit.
	Once this is completed open PulseSensorAmped_Arduino_edited_dtm in Arduino and program the Arduino board.
